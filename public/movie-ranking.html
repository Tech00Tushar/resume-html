<h1>The Best Movies According to Tushar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  Watching Interstellar was nothing short of an extraordinary journey that left
  me in awe long after the credits rolled. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this
  film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema, taking us on a profound
  voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning as it is
  intellectually stimulating.
</p>
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>
  The mind blowing escapes, the plans, the twists and many more things will
  gives goosebumps all time. Every episodes makes such a conditions which can't
  wait for another.
</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>
  Money hiest , the best TV show I've watched so far it deals with mind games
  and strategies which makes you awestruck. If you're an amient fan of robbiers
  and like watching heists then this is a must watch . You'll never feel bored
  while binging on it . What's exciting is the blend of mind games and emotions
  one could have ,your intelligence and emotions don't go hand in hand which is
  potreyed in the best possible manner.
